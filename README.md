# 🔍 Deperto (Zoom by Scroll)

**Stop squinting. Your eyes will thank you.**

Ever tried to read 8px font on a 4K monitor and felt your soul leaving your body? Or maybe you just migrated from **XFCE** and your muscle memory is screaming because you can't just zoom in on a specific pixel anymore?

Nice!

## 🚀 What does it do?
It brings the legendary **XFCE-style Zoom** to GNOME Shell.

- **Point** your mouse at something interesting.
- **Hold** the `Super` (Windows) key.
- **Scroll** the wheel.
- **BOOM.** Instant zoom exactly where you are looking.

It uses the native GNOME magnifier but forces it to behave like a sane tool: `proportional` tracking. That means the zoom follows your cursor, not the center of the screen.

## 🎮 How to use
1. Hold the **Super** key (the one with the Windows logo).
2. **Scroll Up** to zoom in (ENHANCE!).
3. **Scroll Down** to zoom out.

### ⚠️ A Note on "Super + Scroll"
In standard GNOME, `Super + Scroll` might be used to switch workspaces.
**Not anymore.**

This extension hijacks that shortcut. We stole it. It's ours now.

## 📦 Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Download this repository.
2. Copy the folder to your extensions directory:

3. Restart GNOME Shell (Log out/in on Wayland, or `Alt+F2`, type `r`, Enter on X11).
4. Enable via **Extensions** app.
